What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I ran into some errors so I wasn't able to code along with him fairly early in the second half of class. I will watch Bruno's video to get a better understanding of the information.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I love the idea of making something my friends can use.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Trying to keep up with Alex. As I said before, when I ran into an error, I wasn't able to catch up and he had already cleared his terminal screen. I will rewatch the same lecture with a different instructor and hopefully gain a better understanding.
