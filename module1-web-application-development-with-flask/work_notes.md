What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I ran into some errors so I wasn't able to code along with him fairly early in the second half of class. I will watch Bruno's video to get a better understanding of the information.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I love the idea of making something my friends can use.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Trying to keep up with Alex. As I said before, when I ran into an error, I wasn't able to catch up and he had already cleared his terminal screen. I will rewatch the same lecture with a different instructor and hopefully gain a better understanding.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? 

Everything went well so far. Seeing my code make something in a browser window had me absolutely tickled.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Learning how to use basic and semi- advance changes to the text in the browser was too fun and I spent way to much time on it. But I now have a solid understanding of  basic html tags and color schemes.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? I got stuck on installing and using flask-sqlalchemy...I am still stuck.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I haven't begun working on the 2nd assignment because I am still trying to finish module 1. It is true that trying to get the code to work seems to be hard than writing the code itself. Installing Flask-SQLAlchemy was a beast.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Being able to build a database from the terminal line was a lot of fun. I have only used access in the past so seeing what goes on "under the hood" was enthralling. Still haven't got it to work on my end, but I will.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Getting a solid understanding of which terminal I should be working in to make things happen (git v python) I can't seem to to get python to work in git or vice versa. This has been an ongoing issue for me during this Unit.
