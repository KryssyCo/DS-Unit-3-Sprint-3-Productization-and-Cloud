Thursday 12/05/19 What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I haven't begun working on the 2nd assignment because I am still trying to finish module 1. It is true that trying to get the code to work seems to be hard than writing the code itself. Installing Flask-SQLAlchemy was a beast.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Being able to build a database from the terminal line was a lot of fun. I have only used access in the past so seeing what goes on "under the hood" was enthralling. Still haven't got it to work on my end, but I will.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Getting a solid understanding of which terminal I should be working in to make things happen (git v python) I can't seem to to get python to work in git or vice versa. This has been an ongoing issue for me during this Unit.
